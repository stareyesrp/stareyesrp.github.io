                <p class="text-indigo-100/90 leading-relaxed">Lyra possesses the classic, sharp beauty of a High Elf, with an elegant bearing that speaks to her noble lineage and martial discipline. She typically wears practical, yet exquisitely crafted, steel armor that has been blued and etched with swirling draconic motifs that catch the light. Her fiery red hair, a stark and beautiful contrast to the traditional silver and gold of her kin, is usually kept in a series of intricate braids to prevent it from becoming a hindrance in the heat of combat or the rush of flight.</p>

Her life is one of discipline and purpose; she takes her duties with the utmost seriousness, constantly striving for perfection in her martial prowess. While she holds a deep and abiding respect for the ancient magical traditions of her kin, she finds her own strength and calling not in the arcane, but in the physical challenges of combat and the unparalleled thrill of soaring through the clouds on dragonback. This focus can make her appear stern and unyielding, particularly in the face of injustice, yet beneath that hardened exterior lies a deep well of compassion for those she has sworn to protect.</p>

                        <li><strong>Blade and Fang Technique:</strong> When speed is paramount, she switches to a dual-wielding style unique to her.

            <h2 class="font-cinzel text-2xl font-bold text-indigo-300 border-b border-indigo-500/30 pb-2 mb-4">History</h2>
            <div class="space-y-4 text-indigo-100/90 leading-relaxed">
                <p>Born into a noble house of Caledor, Lyra showed an early and profound aptitude for martial training, finding her soul's expression in the clean arc of a sword rather than the complex weave of a spell. Her bond with the sun drake, Elerin, was forged not in a placid, grand ceremony, but in the crucible of survival and shared desperation. During a perilous journey through the jagged Dragonback Mountains, she discovered Elerin as a young drake, grounded and bleeding, his wing pierced by a poisoned Dark Elf bolt after a vicious ambush on his nest. With no thought for her own safety, Lyra defended him fiercely, her blade a blur of silver against the raiders' cruel hooks. In the weeks that followed, she remained by his side, tending to his wound and nursing him back to health, forging a deep, unspoken connection built on mutual trust and a shared, burning defiance. This was not the bond of a master and beast, but of two warriors who had faced death together and emerged stronger.</p>
                <p>Their training was a dynamic fusion of instinct and discipline. Lyra’s structured elven combat techniques provided a framework for Elerin's wild, fiery spirit. In the beginning, their personalities often clashed—her rigid focus grating against his playful, sometimes stubborn draconic nature. Yet, through countless hours of soaring over the glittering seas of Ulthuan, through mock battles that tested their reflexes and resolve, and during shared, quiet moments under the stars, they learned to anticipate each other's every move, to think and act as a single, devastating entity. They became inseparable, a living symbol of Caledor's enduring might, forever bound by the fire of battle and the unbreakable warmth of their loyalty.</p>
                <p>Their prowess did not go unnoticed. During a major coastal incursion by Drukhari raiders, Lyra and Elerin proved instrumental in turning the tide of a desperate battle. While other forces were pinned down by dark magic and overwhelming numbers, the pair executed a daring aerial assault, diving through a storm of crossbow bolts to shatter the enemy command structure. Their synergy in battle was breathtaking—a whirlwind of elven steel and roaring dragon flame that carved a path through the heart of the corsair fleet. In recognition of her exceptional valor and their unparalleled bond, the Prince of Caledor formally inducted Lyra into the esteemed Royal Dragonknights. She was no longer just a noble with a dragon companion; she now bore a title that represented the absolute pinnacle of Caledorian martial tradition, a sworn protector of Ulthuan whose legend was only just beginning.</p>
