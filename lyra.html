Her style is aggressive, focusing on sweeping arcs and powerful cleaves designed to break enemy formations.</p>
                <p><span class="font-bold text-amber-400">Twin Fangs Style:</span> When unsuited for the greatsword, she seamlessly switches to a dual-wielding technique using a longsword and dagger. This style is a whirlwind of steel, using the main blade for offense and the dagger for parrying, trapping enemy weapons, and delivering swift, unexpected strikes.</p>
                <p><span class="font-bold text-amber-400">Drake-Lord's Lance:</span> Mounted on Elerin, Lyra is a devastating force. She is an expert with the Dragon Knight's lance, capable of executing perfectly timed aerial charges that can shatter a unit of monstrous cavalry or pierce the hide of a behemoth.</p>

                <h3 class="font-cinzel text-xl text-amber-400">Early Years</h3>
                <p>Born to the noble House of Sunstrider in the heart of Caledor, Lyra’s childhood was one of privilege and expectation. While her peers were drawn to the intricate study of High Magic or the subtle arts of diplomacy, Lyra found her gaze perpetually turned towards the cloud-veiled peaks of the Dragonback Mountains. She spent hours in the great halls of her family’s keep, not reading arcane texts, but tracing the lineage of the great Dragon Princes of old. The tales of Aenarion and Indraugnir were not mere history to her; they were a calling. Her tutors noted with a mix of pride and concern that she possessed a fire more suited to the forge than the forum, a spirit that yearned for the roar of a dragon over the quiet hum of the Winds of Magic.</p>
                <p>This martial inclination was not merely a fancy. In the training yards, Lyra moved with a grace and ferocity that was unnerving in one so young. While other elven youths practiced the precise, almost dance-like forms of swordsmanship, Lyra’s style was imbued with a raw power and an instinct for combat that could not be taught. She dedicated herself to the mastery of the Caledorian greatsword, her lean frame building the strength required to wield the heavy blade as if it were an extension of her own arm. It was during these years that her core ideals were forged in the sweat and steel of endless practice: honor in every strike, duty to her homeland, and the courage to face any odd.</p>
                <p>As she grew into a young adult, her ambition outpaced the structured life of her noble house. She grew impatient with ceremonial duties and courtly lessons, her heart set on proving her worth not with words, but with deeds. Hearing tales of Dark Elf corsairs scouting the perilous mountain passes, she saw her chance. Forsaking the safer assignments offered to her, she used her lineage and sheer force of will to join a veteran patrol heading into the treacherous Dragonback range. It was not a quest for glory she sought, but a trial by fire—a chance to test her skills against the ancient enemies of Ulthuan and, perhaps, to come face to face with the destiny she had always dreamed of.</p>
                
                <h3 class="font-cinzel text-xl text-amber-400">Middle Years</h3>
                <p>Deep within the jagged peaks, destiny found her. The patrol was ambushed, a hail of black-fletched, poisoned bolts raining down from the shadows. In the chaos, Lyra was separated from the main force, only to stumble upon the true target of the Druchii raid: a sun drake nest. The assassins had already done their grim work, leaving a single, injured young drake flailing beside his slain mother, a cruel bolt buried in his wing. Seeing the raiders move in for the kill, Lyra acted without hesitation. For hours, her greatsword was a blur of silver, a lone, fiery-haired defender against a tide of malice. She held the pass until the returning patrol finally drove the Dark Elves back, leaving Lyra exhausted and bleeding beside the terrified drake.</p>
                <p>In the weeks that followed, Lyra refused to leave the young dragon’s side. She named him Elerin, Eltharin for "Starfire," and personally nursed his poisoned wound, a task that required immense patience—a virtue she did not naturally possess. A silent understanding grew between them, a bond forged not of magic or ceremony, but of shared defiance and survival. When Elerin was finally strong enough, their training began. It was a tumultuous process, a clash between Lyra’s rigid, martial discipline and Elerin’s wild, instinctual nature. Yet, through countless flights that started as struggles for control and ended in breathtaking synchronization, they learned to move and think as one warrior.</p>
                <p>Their first true test came during a Norscan incursion on the eastern coast of Caledor. A fleet of longships had breached the outer patrols, unleashing Chaos-worshipping marauders upon the coastal settlements. While the main host mustered, Lyra and Elerin took to the skies. They were a revelation in battle, a whirlwind of elven steel and dragon flame. They shattered the Norscan front line with a perfectly executed lance charge and routed their shaman-led command with pinpoint gouts of fire. The victory was swift and decisive, and the tale of the "Dragonheart of Sunstrider" began to spread throughout the courts of Ulthuan, earning her the grudging respect of even the most traditionalist Dragon Riders.</p>
                
                <h3 class="font-cinzel text-xl text-amber-400">Recent Years</h3>
                <p>Lyra and Elerin’s growing renown eventually placed them at the forefront of a much larger conflict. A Druchii fleet, far greater than any mere raiding party, launched a surprise assault intended to cripple the strategic port of Sith Rionnasc, the Star-gleam gate. The battle was a maelstrom of chaos, with High Elf sea-guards locked in a desperate struggle against monstrous Hydras and the cold fury of the Dark Elf corsairs. The sky itself was a battlefield, filled with dark pegasi and the menacing silhouettes of the Druchii fleet. It was here that Lyra’s overconfidence became a weapon; she and Elerin undertook a suicidal dive straight towards the flagship, a vessel commanded by a dreaded sorcerer of Ghrond.</p>
                <p>Their daring assault was the turning point. Ignoring the storm of repeater bolt-thrower fire, they descended upon the ship's command deck. Lyra’s blade cut down the sorcerer’s elite guard while Elerin’s fire cleansed the deck and shattered the master’s profane altar, breaking the dark enchantments that were turning the tide of the naval battle. With their command structure broken and their dark magic severed, the Druchii fleet faltered and was soon routed by the resurgent High Elf forces. The victory at Sith Rionnasc was costly, but it cemented Lyra’s status as one of the greatest warriors of her generation. In a grand ceremony, the Prince of Caledor formally inducted her into the role of being a Dragon Prince, bestowing upon her a title that carried the weight of ages.</p>
                <p>In the time since, Lyra has shouldered her new duties with the same fierce determination she applies to all things. As a Dragon Prince, she is no longer just a warrior, but a leader and a symbol. She trains new aspirants, leads strategic aerial patrols along Ulthuan’s troubled coastlines, and stands as a sentinel against the encroaching darkness. The world grows more perilous; Chaos warbands press further south, the shadow of Naggaroth looms ever-present, and other, more insidious threats stir in the dark places of the world. Lyra and Elerin now fly in the vanguard of a gathering storm, their bond stronger than ever, their resolve absolute, ready to meet whatever fate has in store for them and their sacred homeland.</p>
