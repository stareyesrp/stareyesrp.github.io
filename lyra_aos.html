            <h2 class="font-cinzel text-2xl font-bold text-slate-700 border-b border-slate-500/30 pb-2 mb-4">Backstory</h2>
            <div class="space-y-4 prose prose-slate max-w-none">
                <p>Born to the noble House of Sunstrider in the Aethelgard, a mountain fortress-city in the Realm of Light, Hysh, Lyra’s childhood was one of privilege and expectation. While her peers were drawn to the intricate study of Hyshian High Magic or the subtle arts of diplomacy, Lyra found her gaze perpetually turned towards the cloud-veiled peaks of the Dragon Spine Mountains. The ancient traditions of the Order Draconis, preserved by her family since their flight from the World-That-Was, were not mere history to her; they were a calling. Her tutors noted with a mix of pride and concern that she possessed a fire more suited to the forge than the forum, a spirit that yearned for the roar of a dragon over the quiet hum of the magic of Hysh.</p>
                <p>This martial inclination was not merely a fancy. In the training yards, Lyra moved with a grace and ferocity that was unnerving in one so young. While other aelven youths practiced the precise, almost dance-like forms of swordsmanship, Lyra’s style was imbued with a raw power and an instinct for combat that could not be taught. She dedicated herself to the mastery of the greatsword, her lean frame building the strength required to wield the heavy blade as if it were an extension of her own arm. It was during these years that her core ideals were forged in the sweat and steel of endless practice: honor in every strike, duty to her homeland, and the courage to face any foe.</p>
                <p>As she grew into a young adult, her ambition outpaced the structured life of her noble house. She grew impatient with ceremonial duties and courtly lessons, her heart set on proving her worth not with words, but with deeds. Hearing tales of Hedonite warbands scouting the perilous mountain passes, she saw her chance. Forsaking the safer assignments offered to her, she used her lineage and sheer force of will to join a veteran patrol heading into the treacherous Dragon Spine range. It was not a quest for glory she sought, but a trial by fire—a chance to test her skills against the agents of the Dark Prince and, perhaps, to come face to face with the destiny she had always dreamed of.</p>
                <p>Deep within the jagged peaks, destiny found her. The patrol was ambushed, a hail of beguiling spells and exquisite cruelties raining down from the shadows. In the chaos, Lyra was separated from the main force, only to stumble upon the true target of the Slaaneshi raid: a sun drake nest. The depraved warriors had already done their grim work, leaving a single, injured young drake flailing beside his slain mother, a cruel, poisoned blade buried in his wing. Seeing the Hedonites move in for the kill, Lyra acted without hesitation. For hours, her greatsword was a blur of silver, a lone, fiery-haired defender against a tide of malice. She held the pass until the returning patrol finally drove the Chaos-worshippers back, leaving Lyra exhausted and bleeding beside the terrified drake.</p>
                <p>In the weeks that followed, Lyra refused to leave the young dragon’s side. She named him Elerin, Eltharin for "Starfire," and personally nursed his poisoned wound, a task that required immense patience—a virtue she did not naturally possess. A silent, empathic bond grew between them, forged not of magic or ceremony, but of shared defiance and survival. When Elerin was finally strong enough, their training began. It was a tumultuous process, a clash between Lyra’s rigid, martial discipline and Elerin’s wild, solar nature. Yet, through countless flights that started as struggles for control and ended in breathtaking synchronization, they learned to move and think as one warrior.</p>
                <p>Their first true test came during an incursion by the Slaves to Darkness on the eastern coast of their Hyshian enclave. A fleet of longships had breached the outer patrols, unleashing Chaos-worshipping marauders upon the coastal settlements. While the main host mustered, Lyra and Elerin took to the skies. They were a revelation in battle, a whirlwind of aelven steel and dragon flame. They shattered the enemy front line with a perfectly executed lance charge and routed their shaman-led command with pinpoint gouts of fire. The victory was swift and decisive, and the tale of the "Dragonheart of the Sunstriders" began to spread throughout the Cities of Sigmar, earning her the grudging respect of even the most traditionalist Dragonlords.</p>
                <p>Lyra and Elerin’s growing renown eventually placed them at the forefront of a much larger conflict. A Scourge Privateer fleet, allied with a powerful Slaaneshi host, launched a surprise assault intended to cripple the strategic port of Helioch, the Sun-gleam Gate. The battle was a maelstrom of chaos, with aelven sea-guards locked in a desperate struggle against monstrous Hydras and the cold fury of the corsairs. The sky itself was a battlefield, filled with dark pegasi and the menacing silhouettes of the enemy fleet. It was here that Lyra’s overconfidence became a weapon; she and Elerin undertook a suicidal dive straight towards the flagship, a vessel commanded by a dreaded Lord of Pain.</p>
                <p>Their daring assault was the turning point. Ignoring the storm of repeater bolt-thrower fire, they descended upon the ship's command deck. Lyra’s blade cut down the Chaos Lord’s elite guard while Elerin’s fire cleansed the deck and shattered the master’s profane altar, breaking the dark enchantments that were turning the tide of the naval battle. With their command structure broken and their dark magic severed, the enemy fleet faltered and was soon routed by the resurgent Aelven forces. The victory at Helioch was costly, but it cemented Lyra’s status as one of the greatest warriors of her generation. In a grand ceremony, the Lord of the Aethelgard formally inducted her into the Royal Dragonknights, bestowing upon her a title that carried the weight of ages.</p>
                <p>In the time since, Lyra has shouldered her new duties with the same fierce determination she applies to all things. As a Royal Dragonknight, she is no longer just a warrior, but a leader and a symbol. She trains new aspirants, leads strategic aerial patrols along Hysh’s troubled coastlines, and stands as a sentinel against the encroaching darkness. The Mortal Realms grow more perilous; Chaos warbands press ever inward, the shadow of Ulgu looms ever-present, and other, more insidious threats stir in the dark places of the realms. Lyra and Elerin now fly in the vanguard of a gathering storm, their bond stronger than ever, their resolve absolute, ready to meet whatever fate has in store for them and their sacred homeland.</p>
