                <h2 class="font-cinzel text-2xl font-bold header-text border-b header-border pb-2 mb-4">Backstory</h2>
                <div class="space-y-4">
                    <p>In the savage foothills of the Jagged Spine mountains in Ghur, Kaelen was not a soldier or a king; he was the First Fang of the Cliff-Eater tribe. His life was a brutal, relentless cycle of hunt, feast, and survival. He led the hunting parties that brought down carnosaurian tyrants and rock-skinned behemoths, providing the bone, meat, and hide his people needed to see the next sunrise. He was a creature of pure instinct, bound not by laws but by the primal covenant of the hunt: kill, or be killed and feed the next generation. He respected the great beasts he hunted, seeing their strength as a mirror of his own, and despised the creeping taint of Chaos that warped them into unnatural horrors.</p>
                    <p>His death was not a glorious last stand against a gleaming champion of the Dark Gods. It was a bloody, desperate, and muddy affair. A warherd of Gors, led by a Slaaneshi-tainted Chimera, descended on his tribe's cavern-enclave during the height of the monsoon season. Kaelen and his hunters met them in the rain-slicked gorge that served as their only entrance. He fought with spear and hatchet, his howls matching the braying of the beastmen, and ultimately buried his hatchet in the Chimera's skull. But he was overwhelmed by sheer numbers, dying with his teeth locked in a Gor's throat as a dozen spears pierced his back.</p>
                    <p>Sigmar plucked that raw, furious spirit from the ether just as it was being dragged toward the insatiable maws of the Chaos Gods. The reforging was agony. It felt like being caged, like having his fangs filed down and his instincts smothered in celestial light and holy purpose. He emerged as Kaelen Stonefang, a Lord-Relictor in the Astral Templars. His innate, primal connection to the spirits of Ghur was reforged into a divine mandate to bind and banish. The savage joy of the hunt was replaced by the cold, righteous fury of the storm, but the change was imperfect.</p>
                    <!-- Added fourth paragraph from the source file -->
                    <p>Now, Stonefang serves the God-King, but the beast within him chafes against the holy armor. He is a loyal and devastatingly effective weapon for Sigmar, especially when unleashed in his native Realm of Ghur, where he moves like a ghost from his own past. But his fellow Stormcast eyed him with suspicion. He seems to *enjoy* the slaughter too much, and the prayers he intones to bind malign spirits sound more like the growling challenges of a predator than a litany of faith. Kaelen fears the day the beast breaks its cage, but he fears something more: that with every reforging, another piece of the man he was is chipped away, leaving only the cold, golden, mindless *tool*.</p>
