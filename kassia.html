                    <div class="space-y-4">
                        <p>Kassia was a fervent believer in the Imperial Truth, seeing it as the logical bedrock upon which a stable, star-spanning Imperium must be built. Her faith was in discipline, duty, and the indomitable will of the Emperor. The Heresy shattered her worldview, confronting her with the raw power of the Warp and the treachery of demigods. Her loyalty to the Throne is now absolute, a cold, hard conviction that the Imperium must be saved from itself, at any cost.</p>
                    </div>
                </section>
                
                <section class="card p-6 border backdrop-blur-lg rounded-xl shadow-lg">
                    <h2 class="font-cinzel text-2xl font-bold header-text border-b header-border pb-2 mb-4">Warp Connection</h2>
                    <p>None. Kassia was a product of the Imperial Navy's rigid doctrines, which taught a deep and abiding distrust for the esoteric. She viewed psykers as unstable weapons and the Warp as a hazardous sea to be navigated by the strange Navigator-caste, not something to be understood. The daemonic horrors unleashed by the Heresy only deepened this conviction into a cold hatred.</p>

                        <p><strong class="highlight">Fatal Flaw:</strong> Pride. She possessed the unyielding pride of a highborn naval officer, often bordering on arrogance, making it difficult for her to accept help or admit fault.</p>
                        <p><strong class="highlight">Fears:</strong> Mutiny, failing her crew, and the thought that the Imperium she fought for might no longer be worth saving.</p>
                        <p><strong class="highlight">Ambition:</strong> To hunt down and destroy the flagship of the traitor fleet master who betrayed her, and to live long enough to see the Imperial Aquila fly over a restored Imperium.</p>
                        <p><strong class="highlight">Ideals:</strong> The sanctity of an officer's oath, the iron logic of the chain of command, and the belief that a disciplined crew can overcome any obstacle.</p>
                        <p><strong class="highlight">Strengths:</strong> Unflinching courage under fire, an inspirational and decisive leader, and a masterful tactician in ship-to-ship combat.</p>
                        <p><strong class="highlight">Weaknesses:</strong> A rigid adherence to protocol that can stifle creative solutions, and a deep-seated distrust of the Astartes she now serves.</p>

                        <p><strong class="highlight">Master of the Void:</strong> Kassia was a veteran of countless naval engagements. She could read the flow of a space battle like a maestro, directing her ship with cold, calculating precision.</p>
                        <p><strong class="highlight">Iron Discipline:</strong> Her true weapon was her voice. She could command the loyalty and obedience of her bridge crew through the most terrifying circumstances, holding the ship together through sheer force of will.</p>
                        <p><strong class="highlight">Officer's Duelist:</strong> She was trained in the formal dueling style of the Bakkan Naval academies, wielding her power sabre with lethal efficiency for personal defense.</p>

                    <p><strong class="highlight">Bakkan Power Sabre:</strong> A relic of her family's long naval service, its elegant guard and crackling blade had seen service for five generations.</p>

                <p>Lord-Captain Thorne was the very image of Imperial Naval authority. She stood tall and straight, her movements economical and precise. Her face was sharp and intelligent, etched with the stress of command but showing no hint of weakness. Her steel-grey eyes missed nothing, sweeping over her bridge with a gaze that demanded perfection. Her uniform was immaculate, a stark contrast to the makeshift gear of the Astartes she transported. She was a figure of cold, unyielding control, a woman who commanded a weapon of city-destroying power with a clipped, precise order.</p>

                <div class="space-y-4 text-justify">
                    <p>Kassia was born into the Thorne dynasty, a powerful family with a long and storied history of service in the Imperial Navy on the fortress world of Bakka. Her path was chosen for her before she could walk. She was raised in the shadow of orbital shipyards, educated in fleet tactics, and drilled in the harsh discipline of the navy. She rose through the ranks on merit and ambition, earning command of the ancient Battle Cruiser <strong class="italic">Tarnhelm</strong> and a place in the 7th Expeditionary Fleet during the Great Crusade. She served with honour, a steadfast and reliable officer in the Emperor's grand design.</p>
                    <p>The news of Horus's betrayal reached the 7th Fleet while it was deep in the galactic east. The fleet master declared for the Warmaster, and the fleet tore itself apart in a brutal civil war. Kassia, horrified by the treachery, refused to break her oath to the Throne. She rallied what few loyalist ships she could and attempted to fight her way clear. The battle was a massacre. The <strong class="italic">Tarnhelm</strong> was the only capital ship to escape, a wounded beast fleeing into the unknown, its crew decimated and its captain bearing the bitter taste of betrayal.</p>
                    <p>Alone and hunted, Kassia guided her crippled ship back towards the Segmentum Solar, fighting a guerilla war against traitor shipping along the way. It was during this perilous journey that she was contacted by an agent of the Sigillite. Malcador required a loyal, deniable naval asset—a ghost ship that could move unseen through the galaxy. Kassia saw the offer not as a choice, but as her sworn duty. She pledged her ship and her crew to the Sigillite's cause, becoming the secret transport for the nascent Knights-Errant. She now ferried them into the heart of traitor territory, a silent, disapproving warden to the transhuman warriors who were the galaxy's last, best hope.</p>
