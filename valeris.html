                <div class="space-y-4">
                    <p>The warrior known only as <b strong class="highlight">Valeris the Gore-Wrought</b> began her eternal service in the golden ranks of the <b class="text-yellow-600">Stormcast Eternals</b>, an elite Vanquisher of the <b class="text-blue-600">Astral Templars</b>. In her prime, she was a terrifying champion of the God-King Sigmar, dedicated to purging the Mortal Realms of the Chaos taint. Her fury was already legendary; she sought out the fiercest foes and delivered justice with a zealous violence that often left her comrades slightly unnerved. Valeris fought in endless crusades across the burning wastes of Aqshy and the savage jungles of Ghur, constantly testing the limits of her own martial strength. Yet, her righteous wrath was a double-edged sword, and while she dedicated all her kills to the glory of Order, the sheer, unbridled intensity of her bloodshed began to attract the lingering gaze of a different, darker power that thrived on indiscriminate violence.</p>
                    <p>The flaw that would become her eternal curse was not sown by any daemon's whisper, but was instead an agonizing byproduct of Sigmar’s glorious, yet imperfect, <b class="text-yellow-600">Reforging</b> process. Valeris fell in battle four times, her soul ripped back to Azyr where it was hammered back into shape. Each time, the process grew harder, the lightning more searing, and the fragment of her mortal soul that remained grew harder and more brittle. Her sense of self eroded; she forgot the names of her mortal family and her childhood home, but the one thing that never diminished was the burning, white-hot urge to fight. The Azyrite energy that coursed through her armour no longer brought divine calm, but a ceaseless, throbbing headache; it brought visions of crimson, pain surging through every muscle in her inhuman body, nearly breaking her time and time again. She began to view tactical withdrawal as cowardice, and any champion who sought peace or respite from the slaughter as a wretch deserving of oblivion.</p>
                    <p>The breaking point came during a bitter engagement in the Realm of Shyish against a relentless tide of <b class="text-purple-400">Nighthaunt</b> spirits. Valeris’s chamber, the Celestial Blade, had pushed deep into the foe, but their Lord-Relictor, seeing the flank collapse, sounded the retreat. Valeris did not hear the call for order; she only heard the screaming void in her mind telling her the blood-tide was slowing. She witnessed her brethren turning their backs on the slaughter, and in that instant, the rage consumed her entirely. Letting out a roar that tore the air, she swung her massive two-handed axe, the weapon <b class="text-red-600">splitting</b> the sigmarite helmet of the Knight-Vexillor next to her. In a cataclysmic frenzy, Valeris turned on the retreating forces of Order, indiscriminately butchering those who had just fought at her side, fueled by the conviction that their hesitation was a greater sin than any chaos had ever wrought.</p>
                    <p>As the last gasps of her former comrades faded, her sacrosanct armour cracked and ruptured, the Azyr-gold blistering and running like corrupted blood-drenched brass. The light of Sigmar was extinguished in her soul, replaced by the raw, surging power of <b strong class="highlight">Khorne</b>. The Blood God, seeing a champion who had voluntarily shed the blood of her own sworn kin and stained the sacred gold of Azyr with it, acted instantly. A tear in reality, a blood-geyser of boiling gore opened above her, and Valeris was not merely slain but violently pulled from the Mortal Realms. She did not return to the Anvil of Azyr; instead, her essence was dragged across the searing plains of the <b>Realm of Chaos</b> to the foot of the Brass Citadel.</p>
                    <p>There, at the base of the mountain of skulls, Valeris’s essence was seized by the Daemon Smiths of Khorne. Her soul was brutally <b class="text-yellow-600">reforged</b> one final time, the holy thunder of Sigmar replaced by the bellowing, bass-note fury of the Blood God's war-cry. Her old armour was not simply defiled; it was melted and reshaped, becoming a suit of baroque, crimson-enameled brass plate, forever leaking gore from its rivets. She was gifted a massive axe that shrieked as it tore flesh, a tool that mirrored the relentless, chaotic power now surging through her veins. When Valeris was cast back into the Mortal Realms, she was no longer a Vanquisher of Order, but a living relic of betrayal: <b class="text-red-600">Valeris, the Betrayer</b>; a true champion of Khorne and the ultimate insult to the God-King, proving that even his finest warriors could be corrupted and weaponized against him. Her only purpose is now to stack skulls, whether from the heads of her foes or her weak-willed allies, for the Blood God cares not from whence the blood flows.</p>
